I'm a developer with a Bangalore based social media automation start-up, a husband, an avid gamer, and lover of movies. I enjoy coming up with solutions for complex problems, creating automated solutions, and delivering JSON wherever I can.

I love to get my hands dirty with javascript to make cool and awesome applications.
