My name is Dharmendra Singh. I'm a full stack developer, a husband, an avid gamer and a movie buff. I enjoy coming up with solutions for complex problems, creating automated solutions, and delivering and consuming JSON wherever I can.

### Tech

I love to get my hands dirty with javascript to make cool and awesome applications, haggling with Backbonejs now a days.
I also enjoy writing backend applications in PHP, designing API solutions and have working knowledge of Phalcon PHP framework.
