My name is Dharmendra Singh. I'm a full stack developer with a Bangalore based social media automation start-up [Around.io](http://around.io), a husband, an avid gamer and a movie buff. I enjoy coming up with solutions for complex problems, creating automated solutions, and delivering JSON wherever I can.

I love to get my hands dirty with javascript to make cool and awesome applications.

I also enjoy writing backend applications in PHP, designing API solutions and have working knowledge of Phalcon PHP framework.
