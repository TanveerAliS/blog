I have been thinking to write a blog for quite some time now but being a big time procrastinator just couldn't do it.

Maybe because  it was too much work for my lazy ass. I didn't want to use a cms and creating my own blogging system was too much effort.But neverthless I did code my blog in parse, which offcourse remained unpublished.

This meme totally sums up my situation.

Fortunately I came across this new thing Jekyll site generator (well new for me !!). I think this may work for me.

I haven't thought much what I am going to write about, maybe I will write about little tricks I learned in my career as a web developer or I will just rant something useless, I don't know, we will see.
