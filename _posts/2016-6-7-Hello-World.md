I have been thinking to write a blog for quite some time now but being a big time procrastinator just couldn't do it.

Maybe because  it was too much work for my lazy ass. I didn't want to use a cms and creating my own blogging system was too much effort but neverthless I did code my blog in parse, which offcourse remained unpublished. This image totally sums up my condition.
